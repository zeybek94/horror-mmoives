its about horror movies 
hey hey hey. I think horror movies is the best movie type because in generally horror movie is felt you all emotions in their story. I love them. I give an example of some good horror/thriller movie : Split , Oculus , Marrowbone , Carrie , Glass , Ghostland these are amazing horror/thriller movies. Horror movies is not for everyone. Just for really quaity people watch a lot of horror movies , generally horror movies are masterpiece but generally sometimes movies are terrible because horror movies budget is too few so people can make a lot of horror movies it is actually very good idea. You earn very money for this job maybe you not.
